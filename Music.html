<h1> Early cartoons and Disney movies had some of the most racist character. And with cartoons and disney movies there comes racist songs.Like the the song Eenie, Meenie, Miney, Moe actually goe4s like "Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo. Catch a Nigger by his toe, If he won't work, let him go". And the song that the ice cream trucks plays actually goes like, "You Nigger quite throwin' them bones and come down and get your ice cream! Ice cream?!?. Yes, Ice cream! Colored man's ice cream: WATERMELON!!, Nigger love a watermelon ha ha, ha ha! For here, they're made with a half pound of co'l There's nothing like watermelon for q hungry coon."

<h1> Back then the word Nigger was seen as a regular thing but the crazy thing is, is that it's stil seen as a regular song. Just because you say Nigga instead of Nigger that doesn't make it any better. Both of the words means the same exact thing but in diffrent ways.
